    "1. User segmentation based on transaction behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ultimately, the purpose is to find a useful way to begin to group users based on a variety of features. Users of the XRP Ledger are hypothesized to fall into categories such as these: XRP holders, Bitcoin transfer users, banks using for intercurrency exchanges, arbitrage, frontrunning? Succesful clustering may allow the development of optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We can seek to attempt to group these according to some of the features of transactions that users succeed in making. Careful combination of these features (e.g txn frequency, directionality, txn volume, txn fees paid, destination account, creation account) can be used for the clustering exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > - Clustering accounts based on how often they transact and to which destination nodes in the network do they transact. As a live visualization, if a node suddenly changes groups this could be of interest, indicating either changing account behavior or new partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   > - Clustering accounts by the fees they are willing to pay and to which nodes (high volume destination/low volume destination)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
